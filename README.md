# Ripoff-Among-Us-because-I-m-bored

Don't know how to get current file path, and don't really want to figure it out, so for it to work, you need a folder called "Pictures" in your D:/ drive, and put among-us-character.png for looking right, among-us-character-left.png for looking left, and among-us-map.jpg for the map
Probably will fix that later
